# ToDo - Kura

- [ ] Feat: Define `LocallyFinite` instance and use that was an assumption necessary for degrees
- [ ] Feat: `union` is `Isom` with `glue` on `inter`
- [ ] Feat: `glue` between end points of two `PathGraph`s is `Isom` with a longer `PathGraph`
- [ ] Feat: `PathGraph` and etc. are `LocallyFinite`

## Done

- [x] Chore: Have `Isom` lemmas so that `simp` solves forwards and backwards applications canceling each other out
